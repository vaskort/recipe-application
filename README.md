# The challenge

The application is a food / recipe application that will help users
become better at cooking. Unfortunately the product manager has dumped
a bunch of specifications on you and done a runner!

Your task is to develop an application that fulfils _some_ or _all_ of the
specification provided.

## What are we looking for?

The aim of the task is to give you the opportunity to show **your** skills
in web development. The specification is deliberately open for that
reason. If you aren't strong in front-end development or you haven't
done much server-side development, don't worry... **Play to your strengths!**

We are also very interested in _non-coding_ aspects and how you approach
problems, please supply any notes you make, such as showing your working,
questions you might want to ask and assumptions you may have made. You could
also use comments in any code you supply to communicate your reasoning as you 
work.

## Technology choices

The server-side languages that will be accepted are limited to:-
* Node.js
* Java
* Scala

You may pick whichever client and/or server side frameworks you feel
are suited to the task at hand. 

## Where to start

The `features` folder contains the behavioural specifications of the
application to be built. Start by reading through these feature files,
they should give you a sense of what is required. Remember, you don't 
_have_ to satisfy them all!

##Â Submitting your test

Please either:

* Check your source code into a public github repository and email
the repository location to the contact email provided; OR
* Create an archive (zip, tar) and send the archive via email.
