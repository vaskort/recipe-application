## About CSS

I used SASS for this project though I can work comfortably with LESS, I have a preference to SASS though for some reason

Maybe I overdid it with separating everything (see _variables.scss file), just wanted to show how I would structure a project from the beginning so it would be easier to scale and maintain later on

Moreover, I decided not to use Bootstrap or Foundation

## About bundling CSS and JS  

Again here I could use an easier way to bundle my files instead of Webpack. For instance, I could use watchify which is a simple way to bundle for JS and a sass-middleware for express to serve my Sass file. With Webpack though you can do both.
